## FAQ

### Where to get videos from


Here is a link to my Google Drive to download the videos if you haven't got OneDrive locally. This is a zip file; you have to unzip it, and that folder is the file path directory.


#### Google Drive - Click the Drive Button Below

### Setting up the File Path txt

Open the folder with the code under the project folder under ```dist```, open the folder ```1.1.angletimedata```

![filepathimage](https://i.imgur.com/EoqonTS.png)


Open this file and paste it in your copied file directory. There is a folder called ```1.1.angletimedata```, in this folder you will find both
the filepath file for the video and also the place where you get the output of the video file, which produces the angle, timestamp and the frame count.
**Make sure you Save This File**
